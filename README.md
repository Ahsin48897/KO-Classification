# KO-Classification_
# Cutting-Edge Deep Learning Approach for Multi-class Knee Osteoarthritis Diagnosis Support System

Knee osteoarthritis (KO), which affects both elderly and young individuals, leads to restricted joint movements. Early diagnosis and detection are crucial, as treatment options become limited at advanced stages. Traditional diagnostic methods are subjective and prone to errors, highlighting the need for deep learning models to automate KO image classification. This paper introduces a novel deep learning model that combines ConvMixer for feature extraction with Transformers for global context modeling, providing a robust solution for KO classification. The proposed model aims to categorize images into KO-positive and KO-negative groups and further distinguish between various severity grades, ranging from 0 ("healthy knees") to 4 ("severe KO"). These grades reflect the progression from normal joint structures to severe joint damage, including bone growth, joint space reduction, and joint shape distortion.
To validate the model's effectiveness, two experiments were conducted using different datasets. In the first experiment, ConvMixer and Transformers were utilized for both feature extraction and classification, achieving an accuracy of 92%. In the second experiment, ConvMixer and Transformers were again used for feature extraction, but classification was performed using Adaboost, resulting in an improved accuracy of 97%. This study demonstrates the preliminary application of ConvMixer and highlights the ability of the Transformers model to capture and integrate global context in KO classification, achieving remarkable accuracy and robustness.
